Last Updated: April 10, 2025

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of any software, applications, tools, source code, content, or services (collectively, the "Software") developed, published, or otherwise distributed by Belowcode, a small independent game and software studio operated by Quantum ("we", "us", or "our").

By accessing or using any Belowcode Software, whether via GitHub, direct download, or eventual distribution platforms such as Steam or Epic Games, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms.

1. License Grant
Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Belowcode grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install, use, and execute the Software for personal or internal non-commercial purposes, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Belowcode.

2. Ownership and Intellectual Property
The Software and all associated technologies, assets, and documentation are the exclusive property of Belowcode or its licensors. This includes all copyrights, trademarks, design rights, and trade secrets.

The term "Belowcode" refers to the studio name and brand, copyrighted by Quantum.

Specific names such as TTM™ (Tiny Trained Model), LTLM™ (Low-Tech Language Model), and BRAINLET™ are proprietary and listed under NOTICE, which is integrated into these Terms by reference.

You agree not to reproduce, redistribute, reverse-engineer, modify, or publicly distribute the Software or any portion thereof unless explicitly permitted.

3. Platform Distribution
Although currently distributed primarily via GitHub and private channels, Belowcode reserves the right to release software via commercial storefronts, including but not limited to:

Steam

Epic Games Store

By accessing the Software through those platforms, you also agree to comply with the terms and conditions of those platforms in addition to this ToS.

4. Prohibited Conduct
You agree not to:

Disassemble, decompile, or reverse-engineer any executable versions of the Software

Use the Software in violation of any applicable law or regulation

Sell, sublicense, or exploit the Software for commercial gain without prior written consent from Belowcode

Misrepresent your affiliation with Belowcode or impersonate Quantum

Violate the Belowcode EULA or NDA if you’ve agreed to them

Any such activity may result in termination of your license, legal action, and/or other remedies.

5. Termination
Belowcode may, at its sole discretion, revoke your license to use the Software at any time, for any reason or no reason, without prior notice. You may also terminate this agreement by uninstalling and deleting all copies of the Software in your possession.

Upon termination, all rights granted to you under this ToS shall immediately cease.

6. No Warranty
The Software is provided “AS IS” without warranty of any kind, express or implied. Belowcode disclaims all warranties, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and error-free operation.

You use the Software at your own risk. We do not guarantee that it will meet your requirements or operate without bugs.

7. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Belowcode shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to your use or inability to use the Software—even if we were advised of the possibility of such damages.

8. Export Restrictions
You agree not to export or re-export the Software to any country, person, or entity prohibited by applicable laws or regulations, including but not limited to U.S. export laws.

9. Governing Law
These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which Belowcode operates (Romania, unless otherwise specified). You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Romania for the resolution of any legal disputes.

10. Changes to the Terms
We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. Material changes will be communicated via repository commits or release notes. Your continued use of the Software constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.
